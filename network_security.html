Viruses <span class=\"bold\">insert their code in weak points of a computer system in order to duplicate itself, then it carries out the tasks it was given<\/span>, ranging from encrypting files to taking control of a whole system. Worms are <span class=\"bold\">similar to viruses, but are fully autonomous<\/span> and don't require the victim to click on any links or files. Trojan Horses <span class=\"bold\">disguise themselves as a legitimate program, then stealthily hide themselves within the supposed app to expose you to cyberattacks<\/span>. Rootkits allow the cybercriminals to <span class=\"bold\">remotely control your computer<\/span> through a program that hides itself deep in your files. Ransomware <span class=\"bold\">encrypts your files, preventing the victim from accessing them until they pay a ransom in crypto<\/span>. Keyloggers <span class=\"bold\">track your inputs, allowing cybercriminals to see the sensitive info you type in<\/span>.",

Firewalls sit between your private network and an untrusted network, oftentimes this is the Internet, and scan the data packets trying to pass through. Based on a set of rules, <span class=\"bold\">the firewall can decide whether to accept or deny the data from accessing your network<\/span>. VPNs allow you to <span class=\"bold\">connect to a private network that isn't your own, hiding your activity and IP address from hackers<\/span>. Encryption involves <span class=\"bold\">using a cipher and key to convert plaintext into unreadable ciphertext, and only people with the key can reverse the process<\/span>. 2-Factor Authentication <span class=\"bold\">requires the user to enter a secret code sent via SMS or email along with their password<\/span> in order to log in.",
