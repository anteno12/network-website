This model divides tasks between clients (requesters) and servers (service providers), enhancing efficiency and resource management. A program on the client’s device can request for services or resources from the server and the server will react as necessary to the request. The client’s server model allows for easy scalability for higher demand.

This cable serves as a shared medium, allowing all connected devices to receive the same signal simultaneously. Data transmission occurs by each device listening for its address on the shared cable, and only responding to messages intended for it. Advantages of the bus topology are that it is simple and cost-effective compared to other topologies as it needs less cabling and is easier to install. It is also easy to scale as it is easy to add devices to the network. Disadvantages of the bus topology is that there is a single point of failure the whole network will be affected. The more devices connected to the network, the more laid is going to be on the bus, possibly creating bottlenecks in the network.

It's a common design for local area networks (LANs) and is known for its ease of installation, management, and troubleshooting. Other advantages are that the network can be easily expanded by just connecting to the central hub. The disadvantages of the star topology is that if the central hub fails, the entire network can become unstable. There can also be bottlenecks from the hub if it is overloaded.

Advantages of a ring topology is that it is easy to implement and data can travel relatively fast around the network. A redundancy ring can be added making it a dual ring topology. Disadvantages of a ring topology is that if a single connection or device fails, everything down the line will be disconnected. It is also difficult to troubleshoot a ring topology as the issue could be higher in the network stream. A ring topology is also less scalable making it harder to expand and the cost of the connecting hardware for the devices can be more expensive than other topologies.",

Advantages of the mesh topology is that if any connections are damaged, there are other routes that the data can take to get to the destination. Another advantage is that another device can be added to the network without a disruption. It is also very versatile being used in home networks and mobile networks.
