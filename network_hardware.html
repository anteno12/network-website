            "In networking, a node is <span class=\"bold\">any device or mount that can receive or distribute data through network connections<\/span>. This includes your phone, modem or Wireless Access Points (WAPs). Nodes are divided into two groups; intermediary points and endpoints. Intermediaries are devices such as routers and cell towers, as these can distribute data to multiple IP addresses. Endpoints are the data recievers or senders, devices including your phone and laptop take these data and process them for the user or send them off elsewhere. Nodes are essential in establishing data flow in a network, as these are the devices where data can be recieved, converted and transmitted across the network.",
